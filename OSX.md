# OSX Tricks and Tips
Just some tips from using OSX for a few years. Mostly from a Linux/Window background.

## Use VLC
Don't use any of the default media players. 

## Window Splitting

Hold the green button and drag to the left or right of the desktop.

It will take half of it, and give you options to fill the other side.

## Finder
Yeah, finder sucks.

* Selecting a file and pressing Command-O will open it using default app.
* From a terminal, typing 'open file.ext' does the same thing.
* Control-Click on an item in Finder gives you more options like "Make Aias" which just makes a symbolic link (I think).
* Pressing Command-UpArrow will take you to parent folder in any Finder view.

# Other Small Things
* Turn off the 'Genie' amimation in the 'Dock' page of Apple preferences. It's slower and to me at least looks ugly.
* Use [DaisyDisk](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daisydisk/id411643860?mt=12) to see where your space is on your disk. Yes it has a 15 second start pause if you don't buy it, but you'll only use it 1-2 times/month at most.

## Have separate work and home accounts
When you get home, if you use your mac for business and pleasure, have two accounts. Switch between them to preserve privacy and bookmarks etc.

## Manually kill 'Code Agent' activity
Even after you close VSCode, this process will run in the background at 99%. Kill it with fire. Nothing bad will probably happen.

## Start a new finder window
Click anywhere on a desktop and press Command-N to open a new Finder window.

### Use Favorites in Finder to navigate to current projects
